    <big><p>After spending time with these activities, I’ve come to see the connections between them and how they
     shape my way of thinking and approaching life. <i>Programming,</i> for instance, is more than just writing 
     code for me. It’s an exercise in <i>logical problem-solving and creativity,</i> much like doing <i>Mathematics.</i> 
     Both of these require <i>deep focus and an analytical mind,</i> but they also allow for <i>creative solutions</i> to 
     emerge when <i>tackling complex challenges.</i></p></big>

    <big><p>Playing the <i>Guitar</i> adds a balance to this structured thinking. It’s my way to express emotions and 
    unwind after hours of problem-solving. Music brings in <i>rhythm, flow, and a sense of harmony,</i> which I 
    find essential in both <i>programming and life.</i> It’s a form of <i>creativity</i> that feels <i>unstructured</i> yet 
    <i>organized</i> at the same time.</p></big>
    
    <big><p>Reading <i>Self-Help books</i> offers continuous <i>growth, providing me with valuable insights on mindset, 
    productivity, and how to lead a balanced life.</i> This has a direct impact on my hobbies like programming
     and mathematics, as I’ve learned how to improve <i>my focus, stay disciplined, and maintain a positive 
     attitude</i> through all challenges.</p></big>
    
    <big><p>Finally, diving deep into <i>Meditation and Spirituality</i> offers me a way to understand myself on a more profound level. 
    It’s not just about practicing mindfulness or meditation, but about gaining <i>clarity on the bigger picture</i>
    and seeing the <i>interconnections between all areas of life</i>. Spirituality helps me <i>stay grounded and maintain
     perspective,</i> ensuring that I approach each of my hobbies with <i>intention and purpose.</i></p></big>
    
    <big><p>Together, these hobbies form a cohesive part of <i>Who I Am,</i> balancing the <i>technical</i> with the <i>creative,</i> 
    the <i>mental</i> with the <i>emotional,</i> and the <i>practical</i> with the <i>spiritual.</i> They all contribute to my continuous 
    journey of <i>"Self-Improvement"</i> and <i>"Understanding the World Around Me"</i>.</p></big>
